Magento is an extensible and modular e-commerce platform. It provides several features out of the box, such as CMS, payment methods, layout control and a flexible pricing system.

It has a vast Marketplace with several themes and plugins which can be paid or free. [Check out the official Marketplace site](https://marketplace.magento.com).

Additionally Magento has a private [REST API](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/rest/bk-rest.html) where you can upload and integrate your inventory with any custom solution.
